## Build Locally

Follow these steps to build and test the GitHub Pages site locally using Jekyll:

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/guides/getting_started.html). We recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage Ruby versions.
2. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the repository directory and set the Ruby version to 3.3.0 by running `rbenv install`.
4. Install Jekyll and other dependencies by running `bundle install`.
5. Start the local server by running `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
6. Access the site by opening `http://localhost:4000` in your web browser.
